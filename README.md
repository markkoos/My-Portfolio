# Creating a Work Portfolio using HTML and CSS

## This application displays my current ability to deploy HTML and CSS code to create a portfolio to show my work and coding projects. ##

This can serve as a base for me to come back and add to/improve on later on in my career when I learn more skills that I can deploy into a work portfolio.

In addition to creating an easy to read website with navigation tools to my work and different areas of the webpage, I'm also supposed to make use of media queries to make sure that my website can be viewed properly with devices with different resolutions (ie. mobile phones).
